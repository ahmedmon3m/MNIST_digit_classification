MNIST_digit_classification_using_CNN and RNN
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
#Model
 Top-performing models are deep learning convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, However, RNN Model achieve classification accuracy of 97%
